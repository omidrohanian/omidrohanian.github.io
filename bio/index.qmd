My name is **Omid Rohanian**. I hold a PhD in Computer Science (Natural Language Processing), and I am a researcher in computational linguistics and biomedical language processing.

I am the co-developer of [CompactBioBERT](https://huggingface.co/nlpie/compact-biobert) (>2M downloads on Hugging Face), [Llama2-MedTuned](https://huggingface.co/nlpie/Llama2-MedTuned-7b), and a host of other compact language models specialised for biomedical text processing. We regularly release new models via [NLPIE Research](https://huggingface.co/nlpie).
