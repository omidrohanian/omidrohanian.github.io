Our 2023 paper on biomedical NLP has been recently chosen as one of only two Best Papers in NLP worldwide by the Yearbook of the [International Medical Informatics Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Medical_Informatics_Association) (IMIA 2024). 
This award appears in IMIA’s _Yearbook (2024 Edition)_, which compiles the most influential contributions to global medical informatics. In a field that’s always on the move, this recognition shows the lasting resonance of our work.
